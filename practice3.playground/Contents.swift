 Make a protocol that describes a building. It should require:
 
     A property storing how many rooms it has.
     A property storing the cost as an integer (e.g. 500,000 for a building costing $500,000.)
     A property storing the name of the estate agent responsible for selling the building.
     A method for printing the sales summary of the building, describing what it is along with its other properties.
